# Socket Programming Project

This project contains Python scripts for establishing UDP and TCP connections using sockets.

## UDP Connection

The `udp_client.py` and `udp_server.py` scripts demonstrate how to establish a UDP connection between a client and server using sockets. The client sends a message to the server, and the server responds with an acknowledgement message.

To run the UDP client and server scripts, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `UDP` directory in the project folder.
2. Run the server script using the command `python udp_server.py`.
3. Open another terminal window and navigate to the `UDP` directory.
4. Run the client script using the command `python udp_client.py`.

## TCP Connection

The `tcp_client.py` and `tcp_server.py` scripts demonstrate how to establish a TCP connection between a client and server using sockets. The client sends a message to the server, and the server responds with an acknowledgement message.

To run the TCP client and server scripts, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `TCP` directory in the project folder.
2. Run the server script using the command `python tcp_server.py`.
3. Open another terminal window and navigate to the `TCP` directory.
4. Run the client script using the command `python tcp_client.py`.

Note: These scripts are for educational purposes only and should not be used in production environments without proper testing and security measures.
